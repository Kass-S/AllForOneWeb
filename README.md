I like the design. The SayHello Dom wasnt working. I could see the api request in the console. Just wasnt returning the data on the frontend. Everything works.Responsiveness isnt there. I would also suggest adding a main menu button that takes you to the options vs taking you back to the landing page where you have to select the play button again.Over all, nice project!
